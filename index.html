			<!--<h2>FAQ:</h2>-->
			<!--<p>Ok, so technically nobody has actually asked me these questions. I just figured it would be a good format to give you some facts about the game</p>-->
			<!--<h3>On which platforms can we play this amazing game?</h3>-->
			<!--<p>At the moment, I'm focussing on PC. The first thing I'll do after releasing this game (unless there's a horrible flurry of bugs I need to fix) is porting it to Linux and Mac.</p>-->
			<!--<h3>It looks fantastic! There's no way I can run this on my pc! What kind of rig do I need to buy to play this marvel?</h3>-->
			<!--<p>Honestly, it's not that heavy to run. The laptop I use to develop most of this game doesn't even have a real GPU.</p>-->
